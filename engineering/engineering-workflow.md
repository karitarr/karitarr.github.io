# Tools & Processes

## Tools

Our philosophy on tooling is to choose solutions that solve today's problems and the problems we will have a year from now.

## Communication  

### Kari's Email Manifesto: 

Most people suck at email and cost teams a lot of necessary churn and wasted effort. Here's is how to not do that. 

**The only time it’s appropriate to email:**

* To ensure there’s a record of a decision being made
* To provide an update
  * Pro tip- when deciding who to CC ask yourself if you would take the time to individually share the information with each person via phone call, slack or in person. If it feels weird to share with them individually, don’t add them to the CC. 
* To hold people accountable when requesting action
* When you don’t need a response or action within 48 hours 
* For straight forward questions

**When you shouldn’t use email:**

* Anything that requires iterative back and forth discussion 
  * Pro tip- if an email goes back and forth more than 2 times, schedule a meeting. 
* Questions that are not straight forward \(ie. “what do you think of this?”\)
* When you need a response in less than 48 hours

**Kari's Pro Tips** 

* Put your asks FIRST and then give context LAST
* Highlight and bold people’s names EVERY TIME there’s more than 1 person on the thread.
* Always give deadlines and call out the level of urgency
* Bullet lists &gt; paragraphs
* Use as few cc’s as possible, **the more people not the thread, the less responsibility anyone will feel to answer**
* Move to BCC **LIBERALLY**. Every response is an opportunity to refine the audience as context changes.   
* Empower people not to respond by calling it out.  All of those “great thanks!” start to add up a lot especially if 20 people are on the thread. 
* Retrain yourself to default to asynchronous communication. Typically, the most effective people on any team are the ones over at someone’s desk getting the info they need to unblock themselves.  
* Use the EOM liberally. Save people the step of clicking into an email by putting EOMs on comms where subject line can hold the message. 

**Mortal sins:**

* Do not end an email with “thoughts?” Do the work to articulate the action you need. 
* Do not add someone to a thread without context. Even if it's just an "FYI," it's mentally taxing to try and determine what your action is if it's not called out.   

### Chat

* \[TODO: List of channels we need\]
* The "No Hello" Rule
* Response Expectation and Deep Focus philosophy

## Meetings 

* What meetings should happen and at what cadence?
  * \[TODO: Meeting Schedule & Links to Agendas and Notes will go here\]
* What information should we share up and to each other and how often?
