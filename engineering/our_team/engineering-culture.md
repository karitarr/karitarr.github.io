# Our Engineering Philosophy

## Code Quality & Standards

#### Speed vs. Quality 

* _We will be relentless about forward progress._ 
* _We will prioritize not wasting work but not fall into the sunk cost fallacy._ 
* _We will default to making the "No Regrets" move._
* _We will prioritize quality for high risk items & fail quickly for things that we don't know the right answer for._
* _We will not ship user-facing code that doesn't not inspire trust via seamless UX._ 
* _We will test early and often and build infrastructure that lets us iterate quickly._ 

####  What is \*Good\* Code

* _Good code builds consumer trust above all else._
* _Good code allows fast and easy iteration._
* _Good code is simple_
* _Good code is beautiful_ 
* _Good code is testable_ 
* _Good code is automated_
* _Good code is DRY_
* _Good code is composable_ 

## Autonomy 

#### How do we make decisions as a group vs. as an individual 

\[TODO: Decision Making Flowchart here\] 

* Decisions that can't be easily changed later require more buyin  
* High impact decisions require buyin 

#### **Specialization vs. full stack expectations**

* Generalist early, specialists later 
  * Mobile might be an exception 

## StyleGuides

* \[TODO\] Coding StyleGuide
* \[TODO\] Project Naming Convention 

## Career Development 

* How do we define and measure success for an engineer at Good Money?
* Who are the most important customers for our team?
* What motivates us and how will we stay motivated?
* What demotivates us and whatâ€™s our plan to combat these?
