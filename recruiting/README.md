#### What we're looking for: 

For all open reqs:  [2018 Hiring Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bKyZ8-ac4qBOrwVD4eAhjxe6zGZqPUh11p60lJOm8fs/edit#gid=493712985)

Sourcing should prioritize these \(in addition to technical quality\) :

* They value ownership and a sense of purpose in their careers. 
* They are motivated by a mission and not by a title.
* They are hungry and have something to prove.
* They are unfazed by obstacles and chaos. 

## Interview Process

The best interview process is asking someone to do the job you need them to do. Most companies can't do this because it's not scalable. For the first 20-40 hires, Good Money will take advantage of it's size to conduct a more thorough and engaging interview process.  

### Round 1: Screening call \[1 Hour\]

As the first contact with a candidate, your focus is to get them excited about the team and the mission. The goal of the initial screening call is to 1- deliver the pitch and explain the company to the candidate and 2-  assess how qualified, available, and interested the candidate is.

**AFTER** **ROUND 1:** Following Screening call, update the \*Stage\* field [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bKyZ8-ac4qBOrwVD4eAhjxe6zGZqPUh11p60lJOm8fs/edit#gid=0) from _"Screening Call"_ to _"Technical Interview"_

### Round 2:  Interviews \[1 Hour\] 

#### Interview 1: Technical 

In the future, we will build out a formal coding interview loop, but for the initial round of hiring, we will only be recruiting candidate's whose experience level immediately qualifies them. Instead, the technical interview will be used mainly to assess any technical specialties / interests and culture fit. \*[food for thought](https://zachholman.com/posts/startup-interviewing-is-fucked/#collaborate)

**Questions to Gauge Tech:**

* What are you better at and worse at than most other engineers?
* Tell me about the first thing you built when you learned to program.
*  What are your favorite tech blogs, podcasts, twitter accounts etc?
* What kind of tech projects do you work on in your spare time?
* When you don't know the answer to something, what's the first and second thing you do?

#### Interview 2: Culture Fit  

The culture fit interview is done by a second member of the engineering team and is used to assess what culture a candidate will bring to the team. 

**Questions to Gauge Culture:**

* Design your dream job. 

**AFTER ROUND 2:** Submit feedback to the hiring manager and ****update the \*Stage\* field [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bKyZ8-ac4qBOrwVD4eAhjxe6zGZqPUh11p60lJOm8fs/edit#gid=0) from _"_ _"Technical Interview"_ to _"Work Trial"_



### Round 3: **Paid Work Trial \[1 Week\]** 

If done well, this round will act as a signal that both sides are willing to spend the time working together and get it right. For early hires, this will likely be a take-home architecture exercise, where the candidate is working on research and design and will produce a white paper. For later hires, this will include more feature building and bug fixing. During this round we're looking for engagement, collaboration and ability to execute. 

### Round 4: Round Table

Upon completion of the 1 week work Trial, everyone involved with the hiring process must make a "fuck yes" or "no" decision. Candidates who do not get 100% "fuck yes" will not continue.  

### Round 5: **Leadership Close Meeting** 

All recruiting efforts will end with a closing interview with at least 1 founder of the company. The goal of this interview is to address any concerns head-on that the candidate may have with the company and close the deal. \*Note VP level and above will have interview with the CEO prior to the round table.   

### Round 6: Offer 

1. References: Hiring manager will check references for candidates \(where applicable\). 
2. Hiring Package: 
   1. Hiring manager completes salary negotiation conversations between candidate \(and HR if necessary\)
   2. Hiring manager sends email to legal \(Brooke\) to draw up offer letter & contract. 

## Moving Candidates Through the Process

2. Candidates should not go longer than 5 days without hearing from someone about next steps.
3.
